## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **PMI-based DIM** (`PMIMethod`) — 4th direction method based on theoretical Definition 2.2
  - Formula: `DIM = Σ sign(δ_Y(x)) · C(x) / I(Y;X)` where `C(x) = p(x) · D_KL(p(Y|X=x) ‖ p(Y))`
  - Uses `internal/histogram` for consistency with SURD
  - 6 dedicated tests + 1 godoc example
- **DirectionProfile** — regime-based direction detection for non-monotonic systems
  - Detects U-shaped, threshold, and regime-switching relationships
  - Returns per-regime direction with boundaries and sample counts
  - 5 tests + 2 godoc examples
- **MI-weighted direction aggregation** — variable pair directions weighted by mutual information from SURD
- **Public SCIC documentation** (`docs/SCIC.md`) — quick start, configuration, interpreting results

### Changed
- **Conflict Index inverted** — intuitive semantics: `0` = aligned, `1` = opposing (was reversed)
  - Formula: `Conflict = 1 - |d₁+d₂|/(|d₁|+|d₂|)`
  - All tests and examples updated to match new semantics
- **SCIC test coverage**: 94.6% → ~95% (70 tests/examples, was 52+16)
- **Direction methods**: 4 methods available (Quartile, MedianSplit, Gradient, PMI)
- **README.md**: Updated SCIC coverage, examples count, DirectionProfile mention
